# Linked List Implementations in Java

This repository contains two Java implementations of the **Linked List** data structure:

- 🧵 **Singly Linked List**
- 🔁 **Doubly Linked List**

Both implementations support common operations such as insertion, deletion, traversal, and reversing (for singly linked list).

## ✅ Features

### Singly Linked List (`SinglyLinkedList.java`)

- Insert at the beginning
- Append at the end
- Insert at any valid position
- Delete from beginning, end, or any position
- Reverse the list
- Display all elements
- Track current size

### Doubly Linked List (`DoublyLinkedList.java`)

- Insert at the beginning
- Append at the end
- Insert at any valid position
- Delete from beginning, end, or any position
- Display elements in both forward and reverse order
- Track current size

## 📦 Usage

You can compile and run each class independently to test their behavior.
